# Sinhala Word2Vec Model with Custom Stopwords and Lemmatization

## Description:
Our Sinhala Word2Vec model is a powerful natural language processing tool designed to process and understand the Sinhala language. Leveraging the capabilities of NLTK, Gensim, and a custom Sinhala stopwords and lemmatization package, this model allows users to explore and analyze the semantic relationships between words in the Sinhala language.

## Key Features:

1. Sinhala Language Support:
Our model is specifically tailored to work with the Sinhala language, making it a valuable resource for those interested in Sinhala text analysis, sentiment analysis, and other NLP tasks.

2. Word Embeddings with Word2Vec:
The Word2Vec algorithm is used to create word embeddings. This allows us to represent Sinhala words as vectors in a multi-dimensional space, capturing their semantic meaning and relationships. These word vectors can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as document classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.

3. Custom Sinhala Stopwords:
We've created a custom list of Sinhala stopwords to improve the quality of word vectors and ensure that irrelevant and common words are excluded from the analysis. This list is optimized for Sinhala language processing.

4. Lemmatization Package:
Our custom lemmatization package ensures that words in the Sinhala language are reduced to their base or root forms. This simplifies text analysis and ensures that different inflections of the same word are treated as a single entity, enhancing the model's accuracy.

5. User-Friendly Integration:
Our Word2Vec model is integrated with NLTK and Gensim, making it user-friendly and easily accessible for researchers, developers, and data scientists. It's available as part of a Python package for effortless integration into various NLP projects.

## Applications:

1. Sentiment Analysis: Understand and analyze sentiment in Sinhala text, making it suitable for businesses and organizations interested in tracking customer opinions and feedback.

2. Content Recommendation: Improve content recommendations on Sinhala-language websites and platforms by understanding semantic relationships between words and documents.

3. Information Retrieval: Enhance search engines by providing more accurate and relevant results in Sinhala.

4. Text Classification: Improve the accuracy of document categorization and topic modeling in Sinhala.

5. Language Understanding: Enable chatbots, virtual assistants, and other language processing systems to understand and respond to Sinhala queries effectively.

Our Sinhala Word2Vec model, empowered by NLTK, Gensim, and our custom stopwords and lemmatization package, offers an advanced solution for Sinhala language processing and NLP tasks, contributing to a deeper understanding of the Sinhala language and its various applications.
